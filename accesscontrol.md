# Access Control Models

### Discretionary access control (DAC) 
- *granted access rights based on rules that users specify*  

In this method, the owner or administrator of the protected system, data, or resource sets the policies for who is allowed access. 

### Mandatory access control (MAC) 

- *granted access based on information clearance*
- *are assigned based on regulations from a central authority*

In this nondiscretionary model, people are granted access based on an information clearance. A central authority regulates access rights based on different security levels. It’s common in government and military environments. 

### Role-based access control (RBAC) 

- *granted access based on a user's role*
- *implements key security principles such as "least privilege" and "seperation of privilege".*
- *Allows access to information that's deemed necessary for their role.*

RBAC grants access based on defined business functions rather than the individual user’s identity. The goal is to provide users with access only to data that’s been deemed necessary for their role within the organizations. This widely used method is based on a complex combination of role assignments, authorizations, and permissions. 

### Attribute-based access control (ABAC)

- *granted access based on an assigned series of user's attributes.*

In this dynamic method, access is based on a set of attributes and environmental conditions, such as time of day and location, assigned to both users and resources.
