## Governance, Compliance, Data Sovereignty and Risk Management

### GDPR  
**General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** is the toughest privacy and security law in the world. Though it was drafted and passed by the European Union (EU), it imposes obligations onto organizations anywhere, so long as they target or collect data related to people in the EU.

### PCI DSS  
**Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS)** The Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards (DSS) is a global information security standard designed to prevent fraud through increased control of credit card data. Organizations of all sizes must follow PCI DSS standards if they accept payment cards from the five major credit card brands, Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and the Japan Credit Bureau (JCB). Compliance with PCI DSS is required for any organization that stores, processes, or transmits payment and cardholder data.

### NIST RMF
**National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Risk Management Framework (RMF)** The NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) provides a comprehensive, flexible, repeatable, and measurable *7-step process* that any organization can use to manage information security and privacy risk for organizations and systems and links to a suite of NIST standards and guidelines to support implementation of risk management programs to meet the requirements of the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA).
1. **PREPARE** - Essential activities to prepare the organization to manage security and privacy risks 
2. **CATEGORIZE** - Categorize the system and information processed, stored, and transmitted based on an impact analysis
3. **SELECT** - Select the set of [NIST SP 800-53 controls](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-5/final) to protect the system based on risk assessment(s)
4. **IMPLEMENT** - Implement the controls and document how controls are deployed
5. **ACCESS** - Assess to determine if the controls are in place, operating as intended, and producing the desired results
6. **AUTHORIZE** - Senior official makes a risk-based decision to authorize the system (to operate)
7. **MONITOR** - Continuously monitor control implementation and risks to the system

### ISO / IEC
The **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)** is an independent nongovernmental organization and the world's largest developer of voluntary international standards. The **International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)** is the world's leading organization for the preparation and publication of international standards for electrical, electronic, and related technologies.

Published under the joint ISO/IEC subcommittee, the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards outlines hundreds of controls and control mechanisms to help organizations of all types and sizes keep information assets secure. These global standards provide a framework for policies and procedures that include all legal, physical, and technical controls involved in an organization's information risk management processes.

ISO/IEC 27001 is a security standard that formally specifies an Information Security Management System (ISMS) that is intended to bring information security under explicit management control. As a formal specification, it mandates requirements that define how to implement, monitor, maintain, and continually improve the ISMS. It also prescribes a set of best practices that include documentation requirements, divisions of responsibility, availability, access control, security, auditing, and corrective and preventive measures. Certification to ISO/IEC 27001 helps organizations comply with numerous regulatory and legal requirements that relate to the security of information.

### HIPAA
**Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)** The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is a federal law that required the creation of national standards to protect sensitive patient health information from being disclosed without the patient’s consent or knowledge. The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued the HIPAA Privacy Rule to implement the requirements of HIPAA.

### FERPA
The **Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)** is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education.

These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level.

### ECPA
**Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA)** The Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the Stored Wire Electronic Communications Act are commonly referred together as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) of 1986.  The ECPA updated the Federal Wiretap Act of 1968, which addressed interception of conversations using "hard" telephone lines, but did not apply to interception of computer and other digital and electronic communications.  Several subsequent pieces of legislation, including The USA PATRIOT Act, clarify and update the ECPA to keep pace with the evolution of new communications technologies and methods, including easing restrictions on law enforcement access to stored communications in some cases.
