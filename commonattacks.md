# Common Cyber Attacks

A cyberattack is a malicious and deliberate attempt by an individual or organisation to breach the information system of another individual or organisation. Usually, the attacker seeks some type of benefit from disrupting the victim’s network.

## Malware
Malicious Code (Maleware) A program that is covertly inserted into another program with the intent to destroy data, run destructive or intrusive programs, or otherwise compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the victim’s data, applications, or operating system. A virus, worm, Trojan horse, or other code-based entity that infects a host. Spyware and some forms of adware are also examples of malicious code (malware).

  - **Viruses** A computer program that can copy itself and infect a computer without permission or knowledge of the user. A virus might corrupt or delete data on a computer, use e-mail programs to spread itself to other computers, or even erase everything on a hard disk.

  - **Trojans / Trojan Horse** A computer program that appears to have a useful function, but also has a hidden and potentially malicious function that evades security mechanisms, sometimes by exploiting legitimate authorizations of a system entity that invokes the program.

  - **Ransomware** is a type of malware that encrypts an organization’s data, with cyber actors demanding payment as a condition of restoring access to that data. In some instances, the cyber actors also may steal an organization’s information and demand an additional payment in return for not disclosing the information to authorities, competitors or the public.

  - **Spyware** Software that is secretly or surreptitiously installed into a system to gather information on individuals or organizations without their knowledge

## Phishing

## Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM)

## Denial-of-Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial-of-Service attack (DDoS)

## SQL injection 

## Zero-day exploit
A zero-day exploit hits after a network vulnerability is announced but before a patch or solution is implemented. Attackers target the disclosed vulnerability during this window of time. Zero-day vulnerability threat detection requires constant awareness.

## DNS Tunnelling
DNS tunneling utilises the DNS protocol to communicate non-DNS traffic over port 53. It sends HTTP and other protocol traffic over DNS. There are various, legitimate reasons to utilise DNS tunneling. However, there are also malicious reasons to use DNS Tunneling VPN services. They can be used to disguise outbound traffic as DNS, concealing data that is typically shared through an internet connection. For malicious use, DNS requests are manipulated to exfiltrate data from a compromised system to the attacker’s infrastructure. It can also be used for command and control callbacks from the attacker’s infrastructure to a compromised system.
